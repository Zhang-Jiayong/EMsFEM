Extended Multiscale Finite Element Method (EMsFEM) has been more and more widely used in the multiscale analysis of the mechanical properties of heterogeneous materials and structures, since it has no assumptions of scale separation and periodicity compared to the asymptotic homogenization method and the representative volume element (RVE) method. To further facilitate the promotion and application of the EMsFEM, this paper discourses the basic ideas, principles and implementations of this method in detail, and releases the corresponding MATLAB code for free use by researchers. Based on the work of this paper, scholars can carry out further researches on different multiscale computation problems. Both the oversampling technique and periodic boundary conditions are provided to construct the numerical shape function, and their implementation processes are also introduced in detail. In addition, some typical numerical examples are given for verifying the effectiveness of the EMsFEM.
